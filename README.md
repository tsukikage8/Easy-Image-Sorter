# Easy-Image-Sorter
Personal project to make sorting my images easier. Eventually will have the functionality to show images in a directory and assign keyboard shortcuts or simple buttons to quickly sort images into desired folders.

Welcome to Easy Image Sorter, a Python3 application designed to streamline the process of organizing your image collection. This project utilizes the power of the tkinter and pillow libraries to create a user-friendly interface for sorting images with ease.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The application prompts the user to choose a parent directory containing the images to be sorted.

Interactive Queue: The program intelligently queues all image files in the selected directory, displaying them one at a time within the tkinter app.

Efficient Sorting: Users can efficiently sort images using both button clicks and keyboard shortcuts. The goal is to provide a quick and seamless sorting experience.

Dynamic Directory Creation: Future updates will include the option to create directories on-the-fly during sorting, or users can specify pre-made directories. Buttons for these directories, along with assigned keyboard shortcuts, will be generated based on user preferences.

Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python3 installed.
Install the required libraries by running: pip install -r requirements.txt (not yet created)
Run the application using: python image_sorter.py
Feel free to explore, contribute, and make this image sorting tool even more powerful!

Contributing
Contributions will be welcome in the future! I am still relatively new to Git and GitHub, so I am not fully comfortable with issues or pull requests for contributions. This is a personal project that doesn't have basic functionality yet.

Happy sorting! ðŸ“·âœ¨
