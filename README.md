# Easy-Image-Sorter
Personal project to make sorting my images easier. Maybe it will be useful for you, too!

**Welcome to Easy Image Sorter, a Python3 application designed to streamline the process of organizing your image collection. This project utilizes the power of the tkinter and pillow libraries to create a user-friendly interface for sorting images with ease.**

**Features**
**User-Friendly Interface:** The application prompts the user to choose a parent directory containing the images to be sorted. It also prompts the user to choose the sub-folders to sort the images into, and builds the sort buttons based off of these chosen folders.

**Interactive Queue:** The program intelligently queues all image files in the selected directory, displaying them one at a time within the tkinter app.

**Efficient Sorting:** Users can efficiently sort images using both button clicks and keyboard shortcuts. The goal is to provide a quick and seamless sorting experience. Future updates will include a button to move the current image to the trash, without needing to use the program's SKIP button and later delete the file themselves through the file explorer.

**Dynamic Directory Creation:** Future updates will include the option to create directories on-the-fly during sorting. Buttons for these directories, along with assigned keyboard shortcuts, will be generated based on user preferences. 

**Getting Started**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python3 installed.
Install the required libraries by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application using: python sorter.py


**Contributing**
Contributions will be welcome in the future! In the meantime, feel free to send any feedback to molesa@oregonstate.edu. 

**~ PLEASE NOTE ~ **
There is currently -zero- error handling in this program. It is in very early stages of development. The basic functionality is there, but future updates will include error handling/exception management to combat invalid user input, and the GUI's layout and design will eventually change to make the program look more professional and attractive.

Happy sorting! 📷✨
