# Easy-Image-Sorter
Personal project to make sorting my images easier. Maybe it will be useful for you, too!

Welcome to Easy Image Sorter, a Python3 application designed to streamline the process of organizing your image collection. This project utilizes the power of the tkinter and pillow libraries to create a user-friendly interface for sorting images with ease.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The application prompts the user to choose a parent directory containing the images to be sorted. It also prompts the user to choose the sub-folders to sort the images into, and builds the sort buttons based off of these chosen folders.

Interactive Queue: The program intelligently queues all image files in the selected directory, displaying them one at a time within the tkinter app.

Efficient Sorting: Users can efficiently sort images using both button clicks and keyboard shortcuts. The goal is to provide a quick and seamless sorting experience. Future updates will include a button to move the current image to the trash, without needing to use the program's SKIP button and later delete the file themselves through the file explorer.

Dynamic Directory Creation: Future updates will include the option to create directories on-the-fly during sorting. Buttons for these directories, along with assigned keyboard shortcuts, will be generated based on user preferences. 

Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python3 installed.
Install the required libraries by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application using: python sorter.py


Contributing
Contributions will be welcome in the future! In the meantime, feel free to send any feedback to molesa@oregonstate.edu. 

~ PLEASE NOTE ~ There is currently -zero- error handling in this program. It is in very early stages of development. The basic functionality is there, but future updates will include error handling/exception management to combat invalid user input, and the GUI's layout and design will eventually change to make the program look more professional and attractive.

Happy sorting! ðŸ“·âœ¨
